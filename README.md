ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project applies Machine Learning (ML) techniques to predict water potability based on physicochemical properties. The dataset includes attributes such as pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, and turbidity, which help determine whether water is safe (potable) or unsafe (non-potable) for consumption.
ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree)

Scikit-Learn for data preprocessing and model evaluation

Jupyter Notebook for interactive data exploration

ðŸ“Š Key Features
âœ… Data Cleaning & Handling Missing Values
âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualizations
âœ… Feature Engineering & Scaling
âœ… Model Selection & Performance Comparison
âœ… Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix Analysis

ðŸ“ˆ Insights & Findings
Water potability is influenced by factors such as pH, dissolved solids, and chloramines.

Certain machine learning models achieve high accuracy in predicting safe water sources.

Feature importance analysis helps in understanding key contributors to potability.
